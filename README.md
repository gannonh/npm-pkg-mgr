# bash script NPM package manager

1. change my github profile @gannonh to yours in ```pkgmgr.sh``` (line 58)
2. make the script executable: ```chmod +x pkgmgr.sh```
3. execute the script from the root directory of your package manager dir; the script assumes that your project structure is as follows:
   
    ```bash
    my-npm-packages/
        my-package-1
        my-package-2
    ```
